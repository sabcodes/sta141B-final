Our project conclusions and visualizations are included in the 
jupyter notebook (Date-Graphs notebook file) and in the html file found in the folder `d3-vis`

The html file `d3-vis/index.html` has a d3 visualization of the average per capita infection rates at colleges.
clicking on a state gives the average for that state for colleges in different areas, such as urban or rural. 
Please use FireFox to open the html file to view. It does not work on chrome. Another way to view it is through pychrarm and its local server. 

The original 4 csv files, `us-counties.csv` `us-states.csv` `co-est2020-alldata.csv` `colleges.csv`

All other csv files and json files in this directory were generated by the code we wrote in setup.py

These generated csv files included data gathered from the us department of education college scoreboard api, and the
requests where cached in a sql lite database


## Conclusions

Colleges in the rural fringe have the least number of cases per capita overall, 
however there is some variation from state to state.

Please see the Data-Graphs jupyter notebook file in the root directory for further conclusions.
